## How to Get Involved

We want this project to grow, and we need your help to do it. Here are a few ways to jump in:

### 1. The "Wishlist"
Is there an app you love that isn't in our [Fleet](images/index.md)? 
*   **Request it:** Open an issue on GitHub.
*   **Build it:** Check out the [dbuild guide](guides/dbuild.md) and submit your first image!

### 2. Share Your Setup
We love seeing how people use Daemonless. Join the Discord and share a screenshot of your `podman ps` or your dashboard. Your setup might inspire someone else's homelab.

### 3. Improve the Docs
Found a typo? Is a step in the [Quick Start](quick-start.md) confusing? Every documentation PR makes the project better for the next person.
